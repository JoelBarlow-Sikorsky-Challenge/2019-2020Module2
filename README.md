## Module 2
These sketches demonstrate to the customer that we can successfully load a few
basic programs onto our Arduino.

**Flashing LED:**
Blinks an external LED that at a fixed rate

**Fading LED:**
Fades an external LED in and out at a fixed rate

**Analog Input:**
Fades an external LED in and out at a rate defined by an analog input (Potentiometer). It will also print the delay to the serial monitor.
